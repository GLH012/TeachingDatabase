# ICT342 Teaching Database Project

## Project Breakdown

This project has been picked up by the current Dev team: Damian, Geordie, Jaspreet & Ron. 
It's about creating an Accessible Database, to manage, sort, and allocate teachers for courses.
The database was made in MySQL, as it's a databasing software the University supplies, and works well for the system the client wants.
This will be hosted via Putty, an SSH and Telnet client, designed to run off it's own server.
To pull all of it together it will be compiled with Python to host and run the Front end website. 

This Repository will contain the following project deliverables
* User Manual
* Documentation (With Research & Explanations)
* MySQL Database (With Relevant tables and ERD)
